# InstanceSync
> This project is a fork of the original [InstanceSync](https://github.com/Vazkii/InstanceSync) by [Vazkii](https://github.com/Vazkii).
> It is basically a complete rewrite in Python.
> It also adds a script to generate the modpack manifest.json from a minecraftinstance.json Twitch game instance.
> Both scripts needs at least python3.6.

Git hook to allow for modpack version control without moving around jar files.  
**Requires gson**.

InstanceSync is a git hook that automagically manages your modpack jar files from the minecraftinstance.json file the Twitch App puts out. This allows you to version control your modpack using git, without moving mod files around, neat!

InstanceSync can
* Install itself with a simple script
* Integrate seamlessly with git so that all of the following happens every time you git pull:
* Scan your minecraftinstance.json and mods folder to find work it needs to do
* Automatically download missing mod jars from curse's CDN
* Delete mod jars that are no longer present in the instance
* Handle .jar.disabled files, renaming them properly if you choose to enable/disable mods

## How to Use

* Downoad the [latest release](https://github.com/Vazkii/InstanceSync/releases)
* Extract the InstanceSync.jar file, as well as the .bat and .sh scripts into the root of your repository
* Add the lines in the included .gitignore file to your repository's .gitignore
  * If your repository doesn't have a .gitignore file, just extract the included one
* Run  setup.bat or setup.sh, whichever is appropriate for your OS
* Add something to your repository's README that tells people to run the setup script
